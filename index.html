                    <dl>
                        <dt>Who is the target audience?</dt>
                            <dd>Students of my old high school</dd>
                        <dt>How can I tailor the web site to reach that audience?</dt>
                            <dd>The main colors and graphics will be school related and I will try to use some of the old projects from an older version of a similar site.</dd>
                        <dt>What are the goals for the site?</dt>
                            <dd>Update an old outdated site to be more user-friendly and look appealing.</dd>
                        <dt>How will I gather the information?</dt>
                            <dd>I have an old outdated version of a similar site and a folder of files used from then.</dd>
                        <dt>What are my sources for multimedia content?</dt>
                            <dd>The old files and new images from the current schools website.</dd>
                        <dt>What is my budget?</dt>
                            <dd>Fairly low as most attempts at someone trying to get a website for the school have failed once the person themselves can't update it.</dd>
                        <dt>How long do I have to complete the project?</dt>
                            <dd>It shouldn't take a long time</dd>
                        <dt>Who is on my project team? </dt>
                            <dd>Me</dd>
                        <dt>How often should the site be updated?</dt>
                            <dd>The site would hopefully be updated monthly as the program that it is for is all project based and the website should be documentation of what the teams have accomplished.</dd>
                        <dt>Who is responsible for updating the site?</dt>
                            <dd>Ideally, each team would be able to update their team's pages, but more than likely the classes facilitator would need to take care of the website to make sure it meets school standards.</dd>
