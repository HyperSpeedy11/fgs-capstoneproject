        <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
        <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
        <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
        <p>The &quot;alt&quot; attribute is used on images, so if the page has problem loading the image, it will instead just show the text of what the image would be.</p>
        <p>The &quot;title&quot; attribute is used to provide the user that is currently hovering over a link or image with the name or description of the content.</p>

        <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
        <p>Answer goes here...</p>

        <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
        <p><a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></p>
