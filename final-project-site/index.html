    <h1>Welcome To SCHS EAST</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Star City High School EAST website. Here, you can find information about EAST, including successful projects,
      projects in progress, the type of software that we use, along with plenty other information. EAST is a program where students
        find problems in the community, and solve them in projects.</p>

    <h2>What we do in EAST</h2>
    <p>In EAST, we use sophisticated problem solving to fix real-world problems, both in the community and the environment.
      We must be very professional and stay on topic. Every nine weeks, we have to present our project to the class. We must
        have a collaborator and submit a competition for EAST Conference.</p>

    <h3>Software</h3>
    <p>As we said before, we use multiple types of software in the EAST classrooms. But what are some of these?
    The following is a list of some of the most frequently used applications within the EAST classes.</p>
